            <h1>Get Home Safe</h1>
            <h2 style="opacity: 1;">Mandy Kim</h2>
            <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy1">The silence of night was eerie, almost deafening. It always made me anxious, having to hear the sounds of my reality. It felt like I was subjecting myself to an out-of-body experience—my mind fixated on the sounds happening outside of me, and the presence of those around me. My earbuds were like a sanctuary. Music drowned out the external noise, grounding my mind back inside me—my anxiety, a quiet hum. I didn’t want to give my mind the opportunity to dissect my environment, but I still had to remain diligent. After all, I needed to get home safe.</p>

            <p class="pullquote showthis">“Get home safe.” 
            I made nothing of those words. </p>


      
            <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy2">I walk home, alone.  The walk home wasn’t long. It was midnight. The sky was a deep, dark blue, almost on the edge of black. The new moon, towering above, did very little to guide my way. The streetlights were scattered in the distance, each one casting a brief glow on me before the darkness welcomed me again—the cycle of light repeating with every lamppost I passed. The cold air brushed against my skin, sending a shiver down my spine. Not a single soul in sight. Was I safer on my own, or would I have been safer walking alongside others down this street? I could feel the goosebumps begin to rise on my arms.</p>


                <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy2">My earbuds made a home in my ears as the beat of Deftones’ ‘Risk’ vibrated through my eardrums. An iPhone has 16 clicks of volume level—zero clicks for mute, and 16 is the maximum. I like listening to my music at around 11 clicks—just five clicks under the maximum. Was it a bad habit to listen to music at that volume? Sometimes I don’t even really listen to the music playing. It seemed to solely serve the purpose of masking external sounds, allowing me to tune out my own thoughts—ensuring, in a way, my safety and sanity. But my safety was not guaranteed. How could I guarantee something so conditional and uncertain—so far beyond my control?</p>

          
                <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy4">I turned my music down two clicks. I was just two blocks away from home. Then, a shadow stretched across the ground—and it wasn’t mine. I turn my music down to zero clicks. 
            The night around me was only one click. Anxiety and paranoia began to slowly creep into my veins. It’s too quiet. The shadow was fuzzy, barely distinguishable, and formless with its edges blending into the darkness beneath my feet. The new moon barely cast any light down on me, and the streetlights did little to guide my way. My eyesight was never that good. I strained my ears, trying to make out any familiar sounds. Strange noises, maybe a soft thumping echoed behind me—perhap four clicks in volume. Was someone there? The urge to turn around was strong, but the anxious voice in my head was telling me not to do it. The pattering becomes a bit louder—maybe eight clicks now. My heartbeat quickens along with my pace. Whatever it was, something was there—and I was no longer walking home, alone. </p>

                <p class="pullquote showthis">“Get home safe.”</p>

            <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy5">It rings in my ears. Was this what they meant? The moment where an ‘unsafe’ external force would prevent me from getting home? If I had pepper spray…would I feel safe? What about a knife? A gun? How am I supposed to stay safe when ‘safe’ feels so…uncertain? Is it a state of mind? My thoughts began to spiral. The reality of it felt empty—’get home safe’... an odd phrase of conventional politeness. But what could possibly be polite about wishing someone to get home safe? Was it meant to be comforting? The more I think about it, the less sense it makes. I don’t see it as a genuine wish anymore, but like a reminder that Bad exists in the world—Bad is waiting, lurking in the shadows.</p>


            <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy6">My anxiety was at nine clicks. Should I turn around? I was so close to home—my hands gripping tightly onto the house keys resting inside my jacket pocket. The shuffling noise seems to grow louder the faster my pace picks up. My stomach drops—my heart pounds so hard I can feel it vibrating in my chest. The looming presence of the shadow felt suffocating. I wish it would go away.</p>

                <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy7">Then, it reaches zero clicks. Not a single shadow in sight. I listened to the deafening silence, straining to detect any signs that indicate something was behind me—following me. My heart pounds harder, if that’s even possible, and I quickly glance behind me. Nothing was there. Was anything there? I checked one more time. Not a single soul in sight. Was my mind playing tricks on me? Did my ears deceive me?</p>

                <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="mandy8">I pressed play, listening to Drake’s ‘Passionfruit’,  but at seven clicks this time— lower than usual. I needed a lighter song to rid me of the anxiety bubbling inside me. I turned right at the end of the corner, my hands still gripping on my house keys. I stared up at the house I live in before opening the gate to head inside. I walked up the stairs, pulled out my house keys, and inserted the key. As I turned the key to the left, I quickly glanced behind me one more time—just to be sure. It felt like something was there. The feeling persisted in my gut as I opened the door and stepped inside. My heart continues to pound ridiculously against my rib cage, as I hurry to close the door and lock it behind me. Nothing was out there, I tried to reassure myself. But doubt lingered in the back of my mind, gnawing at me. I ignored it. At least I’d made it home safe—for now.</p>

                <section id="hooktail-plain">
                    <h1>Hooktail Inn</h1>
                    <h2 style="opacity: 1;">Ash Reynolds</h2>

                    <p id="ash1" class="bodycopy showthis">Looking back, I should’ve known something was off right away. The night had been a blur. The drinks, the dancing, and then, the shadow. Somehow, I ended up in a dark room, with low ceilings and puddles on an asphalt floor. The decor was peculiar. The ceiling was held up by an empty, oversized bottle of vodka. By the entrance, a ginormous piece of cardboard read, “Hooktail Inn: A Bar for Brooklyn Strays.” The writing seemed to be scratched in, barely legible. Illuminating the sign was what appeared to be a massive desk lamp craned to the left, filling the room with a flickering, warm light. I could hear the low hum of a crowd further within the room.</p>
    
                    <p id="ash2" class="bodycopy showthis">Walking felt funny. Of course, walking had felt funny since the first drink of the night, but this was different. I turned and faced the bottle and expected to see myself in the reflection. But instead, it was the face of a tortoiseshell cat. Surely, someone must’ve spiked my drink. Or I’d suddenly grown a lot of facial hair.</p>
    
    
                    <p id="ash3" class="bodycopy showthis">I followed the noise into a cavernous warehouse. While people may have abandoned it, it was certainly not empty now. The place was bustling, utterly alive with hundreds of human-sized cats. A group of ginger tabbies played poker in the corner. A group of Russian Blues had set up on a pillow in the center of the room, lounging on top of one another like a lion pride. They took turns glaring at the other feline patrons and licking their paws; utterly carefree. It occurred to me then that maybe the cardboard and vodka bottle were not giant and the cats were not human-sized; rather I was now-cat sized. And then I saw him. The shadow.</p>
    
    
                    <p id="ash4" class="bodycopy showthis">Flashes of the night came back to me. Music pulsing over the overwhelming crowd of the night club. Hundreds of people crammed into a sweaty room, and yet I still felt alone. Then, a smoke break. A disturbance in the corner of my eye. Like a shadow, that I foolishly followed into an alley.</p>
    
                    <p id="ash4-5" class="bodycopy showthis">Now, I stood cat-face-to-cat-face with the shadow. A completely black cat. He stared at me, unblinking and stoic.</p>
    
    
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis"  id=”ash5”><span class="dialogue">What is this place?</span> I thought to myself. Somehow, he could hear me. And I could hear him. <br>
                    <span class="dialogue">Didn’t you see the sign? It’s the Hooktail Inn. The top destination for Brooklyn Strays. Come with me.</span></p>
    
                        <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash6">For some reason, I obliged, following him through the main room, passing the poker tables and the clique of Russian Blues. They eyed me up and down, unsure of what to make of the new visitor. I followed him into the eerie glow of a streetlight trickling in through a high window. Effortlessly, the shadow leaped up onto the window sill. He turned back to me, expectantly.</p>
    
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash7">
                        <span class="dialogue">I can’t make that.</span>
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Yes you can.</span>
                    <br>
                        I sized up the distance from the ground to the window sill.
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Do we really always land on our feet?</span> I asked.
                    <br>
                        No response.
                        To my surprise, my back legs kicked off the floor and I landed gracefully right next to him, feeling the cool air radiating from the window. Before I could celebrate my accomplishment, the shadow turned his head.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash8">
                        <span class="dialogue">Look.</span>
                    <br>
                        I looked. Out there in the alley, under the flickering street light, was a pile of… something. Purple rhinestones reflected off a jacket that looked… familiar. Then, as the flickering light surged one last time before it went out, I saw it. My own face passed out on the pavement.
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Is that me?</span>
                    <br>
                        No response.
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Is that me?</span> I asked again. No response.
                    <br>
                        Before I knew what I was doing, I hissed at him and swiped a claw at his face. He dodged effortlessly, and leaped into the warehouse rafters.</p>
    
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash9">	
                    <span class="dialogue">Am I dead?</span> I asked. 
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Not yet,</span> he replied.
                    <br>
                        I braced myself and followed him up. <span class="dialogue">How do I get back to my body?</span>
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">If you really want to, you just have to go out there and wake yourself up.</span>
                        <br>
                    <span class="dialogue">And if I don’t want to?</span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="dialogue">Then don’t.</span>
                    <br>
                        I turned my head in confusion. Following his gaze, I looked down on the patrons of the Hooktail Inn below.
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Were they all…</span>
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Yes,</span> he responded. <span class="dialogue">You have to be in a certain… state of mind to stray off into Hooktail Alley. Some people decide they’d rather stay and live as a stray than go back to their real life. </span>
                    <br>
                        I turned to him. <span class="dialogue">Is that what you did?</spam>
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">Doesn’t matter,</span> he replied, curtly. <span class="dialogue">What’re you going to do?</span>
                    <br>
                        My gaze darted all around. The strays all seemed to be having a great time tonight. One of the orange tabby’s had just won big in poker, taking the whole pot of treats for himself. I wanted to stay. What else was waiting for me out there?
                    <br>
                        <span class="dialogue">What do you think I should do?</span> I asked the shadow.
                    <br>
                        I turned and he was gone.
                    </p>
    
    
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash10">My mind was racing. I needed more information. Could I turn back into a human eventually? How much time did I have to decide? Did I even want to be human again? And maybe the fact I was asking at all was answer enough. Trembling, I took a step back and felt myself slip. I flung my feline limbs frantically, trying to get my footing on the rafter. As I flailed, I could only think one thought.
                    <br>
                    <span class="dialogue">God, I hope I land on my feet.</span>
                    </p>
    
                    <p class="bodycopy showthis" id="ash11">Then, something coarse swept across my face. My eyes opened and I sprang upward. I was a human again, sitting in Hooktail Alley. I stumbled to where the window should’ve been. Placing my hand against the wall, all I felt was cold brick. Maybe someone had slipped something in my drink…
                    <br>
                    <span class="dialogue">I guess I should get back home.</span>
                    <br>
                    I took one last look at the alley, as though the Inn might reappear on a double take, but no luck. I waited, but the bricks stayed fixed. Then, the course feeling tickled my ankles, protruding from my sneakers. I looked down.
                    <br>
                    Meeting my gaze was a black cat, miraculously dry in the pouring rain, rubbing softly up against my legs.</p>
